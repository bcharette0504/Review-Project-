Planning:

Features:

The inputs being taken are the grades for labs, assignments,and the final for each course during a student's semester. After all of the inputs, our code will output the final grade for each specific class. This development is important to our group so throughout the semester we are able to easily calculate our final grade by just putting our current grades into a text file.

Compile Instructions:

In order to compile the code you will need to use g++, then after running you will be asked to input the certain course, grades and the weight of the grades.
       Ex. g++ grade.cpp -o grades
           ./grades
           "Please enter a course: "
            "Please enter a class section for "
            ". (i.e exams, labs) press '/' when no more secitons are present: "
            "Please enter the grade for "
            "Please enter the weight for "
